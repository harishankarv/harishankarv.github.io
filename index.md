## About Me

I'm interested in building systems that are secure, verifiable, and efficient. My research interests are broadly in Formal Methods, Programming Languages and Operating Systems. I'm privileged to work under the guidance of [Prof. Srinivas Narayana](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~sn624/) and [Prof. Santosh Nagarakatte](https://people.cs.rutgers. edu/~sn349/). Currently, I work closely with the [eBPF](https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/) run-time in the Linux kernel; specifically the static program analysis taking place in the eBPF in-kernel verifier.  

I previously completed a Masters from the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). I worked with [Prof. Steven Ko](https://steveyko.github.io/), [Prof. Karthik Dantu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/kdantu/), and [Prof. Lukasz Ziarek](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~lziarek/) on developing richer runtimes for trusted applications written for the [ARM TrustZone](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone) trusted execution enviroment. I have also worked with [Prof. Anton Burtsev](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~aburtsev/) on designing fast hash tables that utilize the high bandwidth provided by modern memory (DRAM) subsystems.
